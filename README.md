# 🔒 **Secret Message** 🔒
An app made with Python and Tkinter to send secret messages to your friends, with a personal and funny touch!

## ✨ Inspiration
This is a personal project I did while I studying python because I want to be a QA Engineer. I was practicing with a virtual zoo🦁, and then the idea of making something cute for my friends came to me! 💖 
Each friend has a custom password (that I asked them), so everyone can see theri secret message, without seeing the ones for other friends. It makes the app more personal and fun!

Btw, I'm also a digital artist, so the cute dog is a drawing that I made 💖 (you can change the image for your own if you like).

## 🛠️ Technologies used
+ Python
+ Tkinter (GUI)
+ JSON (to save messages and passwords)
